# Build-and-deploy-a-stroke-prediction-model-using-R
I build a well-validated stroke prediction model for clinical use using patient characteristics. To do this, I will load, clean, process, analyze, and visualize data. Then, will build and deploy a prediction model using the cleaned and processed dataset.
